This spike is a functional demostration of reading raw data from Kinect 2 and then rendering an image of current depth view.

I have commented all steps needed to read data from Kinect and how to store data gathered from the FrameReader.

Description for /src/main.cpp
	
	main.cpp is generates a window to push frames to for realtime view.

Description for /src/app.cpp:

	app.cpp is where all the magic happens. That is for understanding how to read data from Kinect, this is the file to reference. Comments describe what and why is done to get the data.

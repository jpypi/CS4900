# System Testing Standards
Project should contain the following documents to meet system testing standards:

### Master Test Plan (MTP)
The purpose of the MTP is to provide an overall test plan as well as the test management across different category of test sets.
### Level Test Plan (LTP)
For each LTP the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of the testing activities for its specified level of testing need to be described. The items being tested, the features to be tested, the testing tasks to be performed, the personnel responsible for each task, and the associated risk(s) need to be identified.

### Level Test Design (LTD)
The LTD details the test cases and the expected results as well as the test criteria.

### Level Test Case (LTC)
Specifying the test data for use in running the test cases identified in the Level Test Design.

### Level Test Procedure (LTPr)
Detailing how to run each test, including any set-up preconditions and the steps that need to be followed.

### Level Test Log (LTL)
To provide a chronological record of relevant details about the execution of tests, e.g. recording which tests cases were run, who ran them, in what order, and whether each test passed or failed.

### Anomaly Report (AR)
To document any event that occurs during the testing process that requires investigation. This may be called a problem, test incident, defect, trouble, issue, anomaly, or error report. This document is deliberately named as an anomaly report, and not a fault report. The reason is that a discrepancy between expected and actual results can occur for a number of reasons other than a fault in the system. These include the expected results being wrong, the test being run incorrectly, or inconsistency in the requirements meaning that more than one interpretation could be made. The report consists of all details of the incident such as actual and expected results, when it failed, and any supporting evidence that will help in its resolution. The report will also include, if possible, an assessment of the impact of an incident upon testing.

### Level Test Report (LTR)
To summarize the results of the designated testing activities and to provide evaluations and recommendations based on the results after test execution has finished for the specific test level.

## Other Notes
System Testing shall thoroughly cover functional behavior.

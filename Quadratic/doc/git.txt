Rules for making changes to the project with git.

1. Don't push if you broke something.
2. Keep your commits as small as reasonably possible.
3. Before committing run unit tests on anything you changed plus functional tests.
    If you broke anything, refer to rule 1.
4. Pull regularly to avoid conflicts in your commit.

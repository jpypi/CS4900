This project compiles into a single binary called 'qsolver' by running make in the src directory.

Any updates can be downloaded using 'git pull' and running 'make' in the src directory to recompile the binary.

In the event of difficulties compiling or recompiling the binary, try running 'make clean' in the src directory.

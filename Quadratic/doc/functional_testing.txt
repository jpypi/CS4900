Functional tests are held in the test directory separate from src.

The program binary must be compiled before functional tests can be run.
The binary can be compiled by running 'make' in the src directory.

Functional tests can be run with 'test/functional_tests/functional_test_suite.sh' from the project's root directory.

Results of the functional tests are written to log.txt.
These can be read by running 'less test/functional_tests/log.txt' in the project's root directory.

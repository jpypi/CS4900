All relevent module directories should have a 'unittests' subdirectory.  This directory should containall extra files required for unit testing including a unittest.c file.

'make test' can be run in the module's directory to compile and run the unit tests for that module.

Additionally 'make test' can be run in the src directory to recursively run unit tests on all module directories.

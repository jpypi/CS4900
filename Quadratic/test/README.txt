TEST when a = 0 thus should output an error saying not a quadratic function.
TEST if a,b,c are not numeric values.

functional_test_suite.sh

This script executes a set of test cases by executing qsolver and redirecting
as input a file which and redirects the output to a file. Output files are
generated by redirecting stdout to an output file.

Input files files which follow contain a set of values that qsolve expects as 
input. Each input file has a corresponding expected output file which contains 
the expected output that qsolve should generate given the input file.
 
Input files and expected output files were created by independently calculating
the correct answer by solving for the roots of a quadratic equation.
Calculations were made using wolfram alpha (see wolframapha.com). as well
as using http://www.math.com/students/calculators/source/quadratic.htm
However expected output is created to match the output formatting of qsolver
to make automation consistent.

The functional_test_suite.sh script executes each test and compares the output
generated by the program to the expected output by executing a diff command
on the output file and an expected output file.
	
Example of a single test case:
		./qsolve < input_0.txt > output_0.txt
		diff output_0.txt expected_output_0.txt
		
If the output generated by the qsolver program differs from what is defined in 
the expected output file then that test is marked as "FAILED".

All processing of tests is logged to a log file named:
	log_[TIME_STAMP].txt
	
	where the [TIME_STAMP] is gathered by running data command.
		

Input files follow the following naming convention.
	input_[TEST_NUMBER].txt
Output files follow the following naming convention.
	output_[TEST_NUMBER].txt

===============================================================================

	
Input files follow the following naming convention.
	input_[TEST_NUMBER].txt
Output files follow the following naming convention.
	output_[TEST_NUMBER].txt

The TEST_NUMBER value of a output file corresponds to the output generated
by executing qsolver and redirecting an input file with the idenctical
TEST_NUMBER

Example:
	./qsolve < input_0.txt > output_0.txt
